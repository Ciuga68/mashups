#Sample responsive mashup

Uses the Executive Dashboard app, so that needs to be imported.

Install as an extension:

- for desktop: copy files to a directory under My Documents/Qlik/Sense/Extensions

- for server: zip files and install in the QMC

Start with http://localhost:4848/extensions/respmashup/respmashup.html 
or https://server/extensions/respmashup/respmashup.html
